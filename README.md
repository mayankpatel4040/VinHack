Hacking is building things that you always wanted to have but no one has built it yet. It's to come up with an amazing idea and work tirelessly on it. It is to fail, fail again and fail better. Try out new things and learn while doing that. It's to work together, collaborate and build things that are innovative. It is to be a better programmer.

**With that spirit, [VinnovateIT](https://vinnovateit.com/) is conducting a hackathon, [VinHack](https://vinhack.hackerearth.com/) and invites all developers and hackathon enthusiasts to participate in an interesting and engaging hackathon.**

## Everyone is welcome!
Whether you’re writing your first lines of HTML, building a AR/VR app, VinHack is just the place for you. We will have mentors to help make your idea happen. You will be able to exhibit your skills without worrying about any mortal needs. We will take care of everything :)

## Why should you attend?

#### To make new friends
> **VinHack** provides a brilliant opportunity for you and your team to forge professional contacts and make new friends. With over 300 developers and designers gathering from all the engineering branches in [VIT Vellore](http://www.vit.ac.in/), grab your chance of connecting with people to discuss ideas and opportunities.

#### To learn
> Hackathons are a great way to give back to the community. Mentoring beginners is always helpful for them and rewarding for us. We’re going to have mentors from a number of different organizations present at the venue. Whenever you’re stuck on a problem or need suggestions they'll always be within a hand’s reach.

#### To build
> We are inviting everyone to build on ideas of their choice. Watching software materialize from pure thought, part by part is the closest to experiencing magic we have ever got to. And we’re excited to see that magic happen all over again!
